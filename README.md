## File documentation
* `linear_model.py` : a linear context (skipgrams) based embedding method with negative sampling
* `hw2_dependency_based_model.py`: a syntactic context based embedding method with negative sampling
* `altreduce.py`: (modified based on the existing `reduce.py`) a method for handling unknown word tokens using wordnet; Method 3 as described in the writeup
* `reduce.py`: modified to include unknown words handling; Method 1 as described in the writeup
* `altreduced-w5dim100.txt`: a reduced embedding file by using linear context based model with window size of 5 and embedding dimension of 100 (using altreduce.py to deal with unknown)
* `altreduced-syntacticdim200.txt` : a reduced embedding file by using syntactic context based model with embedding dimension of 200 (using altreduce.py to deal with unknown)
